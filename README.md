As a Java developer, 
I created a Tic Tac Toe game that provides an engaging, interactive user experience. The game supports both human vs. human simple algorithms to ensure competitive play. It features a clean and intuitive command-line interface, efficient game logic, and an easy-to-follow structure for handling turns, checking win conditions, and resetting the game.
The application adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, static vs non static functions. The code is well-documented, making it easy to maintain and expand in the future.
By developing this game, I enhanced my understanding of game mechanics, Java fundamentals, and algorithm design.

//About the Game //How to play
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in empty grid spaces. 
The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. 
If all spaces are filled without any player achieving this, the game ends in a draw. It’s a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and block their opponent’s moves.
